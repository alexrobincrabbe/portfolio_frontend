        Hackathon in April 2025. The Hackathon was in person, and I worked in a
        team of 3 to build a simple AI application. I focussed on using
        LLamaIndex to generate the RAG and include citations in the responses.

        hackathon in November 2024. I worked in a team of 8, 3 of whom were
        developers. We organised our team via slack and had daily standups, as
        well as additional meetings for devs over 4 days. I focussed on building
        the Django backend and connecting it to the react frontend via the
        Django Rest Framework, as well as integrating speech recognition at the
        front end. For expendiency, I used Gitpod to share the development
        environment for the demo (link to video below).

        An early project as part as one of the Code Institute hackathons. My
        main focus was the Wiki page. We used a Kanban and had daily standups
        over 5 days. I gained some experience in merging conflicts on Github.
